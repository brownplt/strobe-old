Coding Guidelines
-----------------

Maximum line length is 80 characters.  Arjun will kill anyone who violates this.

We follow PEP 8 (http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) conventions for
blank lines:

"Separate top-level function and class [sic.] definitions with two blank lines."

Building and Testing
--------------------

> ./Setup.hs configure --user && ./Setup.hs build

Builds the system in ./dist, configured to install to $HOME/.cabal by default.
However, there is no need to install the typechecker.  You can develop and test
it in-place.

> ./test

This runs the test suite in-place.  You can add tests and re-run just this
command.  However, if you modify the type-checker, you will need to rebuild.
